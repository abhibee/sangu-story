brother – Jack. It is a Saturday. “Not today dear.  But I promise to take you
next week when your summer vacations are starting”. Next week Jack said “We
will go for camping today.” You had promised! “Of Course, Dear! We are going
for camping” said Mother. When they reached there. Trixie started setting the
tent. Jack lit the campfire. Mother started cooking the food. Suddenly a panda
appeared. </span></p>

name is Hermister. I see that you are having a good time.” May I join you?” At
first the children were very scared. They got surprised when their mother said
“Of course. But there is a problem that there is no place in the tent.
Hermister said “That’s ok. I will sleep outside. So, after dinner they went to
sleep. At midnight Hermister woke up by some strange sound. Before he could
take a   step, 6 elephants and 12 zebras came running towards them.</span></p>

style='font-size:24.0pt'>The noise woke up Jack, Trixie and Mother too. The
leader of the elephants whose name was Boom Boom said “You seem to be very good
people.” You must live with us in the jungle for some time. Lizzie the zebra
said “Yes, you must live with us. We will give you rides on our backs. Now the
children were very excited. They looked at their Mother and as soon as she said
yes, they got the zebras’ backs. But just when they did there was a big storm
and all the zebras and elephants started running away from mother. Jack and
Trixie did not know what to do so they just held on tight. After some time, the
storm stopped and so did the zebras. But Jack and Trixie did not know where
they were nor did the zebras. Meanwhile, mother was also very worried. She saw
some zebra footprints on the dirt. So, she followed them. Jack and Trixie were
also retracing their footprints. After sometime they bumped into each-other.
They were very happy to see each-other but they still did not know where they
were. Suddenly Jack said “We also forgot Hermister!” Where is Hermister? “It is
fine’’ said Trixie. No! “We must find him, what if he needs us” said Jack and
mother together. So, Boom Boom said “So it is settled then-we are going to find
Hermister.” One of the zebras named Herbetninja said “You can ride on our
backs” And all the other zebras shouted yes except Lizzie. She said “But we do
not where to start. Immediately everyone fell silent until an elephant named
Elfeet said “Let’s just follow the path until we find some clues. They started
walking and riding. They kept on going until they reached the desert. </span></p>

that they were in Mongolia. Mother told she new kids and their father that all
the animals could talk and about their search on Hermister. The family agreed
to help them. Everyone drank water and rested there for the night. The next
morning, they loaded the supplies on the elephants, as Boom Boom said that they
would be happy to carry them, so they started moving on. Soon they were in
China. Lizzie said “How will we find Hermister here?” It is so crowded. </span></p>

a shopkeeper “Have you seen a talking panda come this way? The shopkeeper said
“No” After a while they still could not find Hermister. They decided to move
north. Soon they were in Russia. Makido said “I have heard that Russia is a big
country. Waana said “Yeah. How will we ever find Hermister here?” Herbetninja
said “Let’s look in the half of Russia.” Trixie said “But what if Hermister is
in the other half?” Boom Boom said “Let’s split up into teams. If you can’t
find Hermister, meet back at China.  So, team no.1 was Lizzie and 7 other
zebras, Elfeet, Jack, Trixie and mother and team no.2 was Boom Boom and 4 more
elephants, Waana, Makido and their father, Herbetninja and 3 zebras. Team no.1
went west and team no.2 went east. They also decided to meet back in China if
they could not find Hermister.</span></p>

Waana said “How will we cross this huge ocean?” Makido said “We will have to
build a boat!” So, they started building a boat. The elephants uprooted trees,
the children chipped of tree bark to make oars, the zebras collected tree gum
and the adults stitched leaves for the sail with the help of thin and sharp
tree bark. They assembled the parts together and the boat was ready. They
sailed across the Pacific Ocean with the elephants swimming beside the boat. </span></p>

lives in Peru. Let’s go to him he will know what to do.” Lizzie said “So what
are you waiting for?! Get on to our backs and let’s go! “With great difficulty

name the place and you are there. But watches are very sensitive so I will give
you these small boxes with mini cushions.’’ They set off to a place where not
many volcanos blasted. After reaching there, scientist Micheal told them to
always keep their watches in the boxes when not in use. After scientist Micheal
left they started deciding where to go. Waana and Makido ‘s father said “Let’s

style='font-size:24.0pt'> we are in appropriate clothes too.” They started the
search in Antarctica. Lizzie and Elfeet teamed-up. Suddenly Lizzie and Elfeet
heard a loud noise from behind an iceberg. They rushed behind it and saw a
small door. They went through it and found themselves in a room of ice. They
slowly made their way through it. As they were walking they heard strange bang
again. The bang came from the corner of the room where there was another room. They
opened the door and shouted “HERMISTER!” Lizzie said “Hermister! We are so
happy to see you!” Elfeet said “Now let’s go and tell everyone that we found
Hermister.” So, they rushed out of the iceberg and told everyone that they
found Hermister. Everyone gathered around Hermister. Suddenly, Herbetninja
slipped and pushed </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:24.0pt'>everyone</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:24.0pt'>! They all went slipping and sliding all
over the place. Unfortunately, all their watches broke. Then Elfeet said “Look!
My watch is working” Herbetninja suggested “Let Elfeet go and get the boat.
Till then Hermister can tell us his story.” Everyone agreed and Elfeet
disappeared. Hermister begun – “When the storm started, I ran deep into the
forest. In the forest I found a big circle and I jumped into the circle. And I
found myself with some hunters.</span></p>

which I guess was the Pacific Ocean. When we reached land, we went southwards.
We again reached an ocean. This time I became sea-sick. When we stopped sailing
we were at Antarctica and they left me inside the iceberg in which Lizzie and
Elfeet found me. Suddenly there was a quarrel about whose fault was it to leave
Hermister alone but it fell silent because of a loud sound from the ocean. It
was Elfeet and he had got the boat with him. They started sailing and the elephants
